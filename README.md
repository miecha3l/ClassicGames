# Classic games
This repo is summary of my current coding skills presented in a form of few classic games created by me from scratch using java based
[Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE. Goal with every game is to create it in the most simple, straight forward way. Pure gameplay without any interfaces or crazy features.

## Roadmap:
* Tetris - **DONE**
* Snake - **DONE**
* SpaceInvaders - *coming soon*
* Breakout - *coming soon*
* Pacman - *coming soon*
* Frogger - *coming soon*
* Minesweeper - *coming soon*

And maybe more!



## Want to play?
If you have processing you can download any source file and just run it via processing IDE. If you dont have processing you can download exported applications from
